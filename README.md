Mandatory Features

- An HTML5 video player that utilizes media fragments

- A list of clips to be played in the video player

- The first item in the list should be the full video

- An interface to add new clips to the list by specifying a name, start time, and end time

- The ability to delete clips from the list (excluding the full video item​)

- The ability to edit existing clips in the list

- The ability to play clips in the video player


Bonus (Completed)
